# UniverDetect
This study proposes a universal landmark detection model for multidomain X-ray images named UniverDetect. This study addresses the challenge of universal landmark detection in abnormal bone examinations and provides a solution for automating tracing processes and enhancing efficiency. The model we develop learns the anatomical structure, global semantic insights, and local semantic information, gradually improving landmark detection in a cascade-like approach until the detected landmarks practically correspond to the actual annotations. 
We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing a novel approach where we address the shortcomings of existing methods of incorrectly detecting objects, thus revolutionizing bone analysis by mitigating subjectivity and reducing manual landmark identification time. Our findings can transform how we approach the challenge of overlapping structures when rendering the differentiation of individual landmarks data in 3D object detection, which could be beneficial in advancing the field. Furthermore, the limitations and what can be improved to enhance the performance of our proposed method are documented. This aspect provides sufficient data for our research to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
